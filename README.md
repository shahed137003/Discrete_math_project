# 🎯 Logical Analysis & Cryptography Toolkit 🛠️

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is designed to tackle three major tasks:
1. **Logical Argument Analysis** 🧠
2. **Digital Logic Circuit Simplification** 💡
3. **Affine Cipher and Decipher** 🔐

Each task is a standalone program written in **C++** that performs unique logical or cryptographic functions. 💻

## 🔍 Task Breakdown

### 1️⃣ **Logical Argument Analysis**
📋 **Goal**: Analyze arguments with premises and conclusions to determine their validity and satisfiability.  
🛠 **Features**:
- Generate a **truth table** for premises and conclusions. 📊
- Check if the argument is **satisfiable** or **not satisfiable**. ✅❌
- Verify if the argument is **valid** or **falsifiable**. ⚖️

📄 **Output**:
- A message summarizing the argument's validity and satisfiability.

### 2️⃣ **Digital Logic Circuit Simplification**
💡 **Goal**: Simplify digital logic circuits and analyze their behavior.  
🛠 **Features**:
- Generate a **truth table** for a logic circuit's expression. 🖩
- Simplify the logic circuit to its simplest form and compare equivalence. 🧮
- Identify input values that make the circuit **satisfiable**, or modify it if needed. 🔧

📄 **Output**:
- Original and simplified circuit expressions with their equivalence results.
- Input values for satisfiability or a revised circuit for tautologies.

### 3️⃣ **Affine Ciphering**
🔐 **Goal**: Cipher a message using the **Affine Cipher** technique.  
🛠 **Features**:
- Take a message and ciphering keys as input. ✍️
- Output the **ciphered message**. 🕵️‍♂️

📄 **Output**:
- Ciphered text based on the input message and keys.

---

### 4️⃣ **Affine Deciphering**
🔓 **Goal**: Decipher a message encrypted using the **Affine Cipher**.  
🛠 **Features**:
- Find **deciphering keys** from given ciphering keys. 🔑
- Decode the ciphered message back to its original form. 🔍
- Output the **deciphered message**. 🗝️

📄 **Output**:
- Deciphered text with details of the deciphering keys.
